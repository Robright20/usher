Looking for Bad evaluations it's a very complex topic, and here we will
explain our ideas and how we are going to implent them.


## Moulinette vs Corrector
[TODO]

## Corrector vs Correctors
[TODO]

## The duration
(less than 30min and the grade is > 0)
[TODO]

## The Corrector feedbacks
[TODO]

## Slotologie
(check the freequencie at which two students correct each other)

- the moulinette grade is lower
- the duration is less than 30 min
- Does not compile
- slotologie
- the evaluated feedback on the evaluator
- empty repository
- forbidden function
- norm error
- author file
- check the feedbacks comments(length, too short, generic or automatic. bad words)
