# Usher

Although the Google Dictionary said it's an "Archaic" noun which means, an assistant
teacher, I adapt it to: an assistant for pedagogical purposes at 42.

## About

With usher tool, you provide a period of time (e.g last week) and it will look for 42
students who have done "bad evaluations" during that time.
As a result, you will have the `evaluation date` and the `logins of participants`.

## Bad evaluations ?

The criteria that we used to define are very subjectives, so be carefull if you try
to use it in real life.

- the moulinette grade is lower
- the evaluated feedback on the evaluator
- empty repository
- forbidden function
- norm error
- author file
- check the feedbacks comments(length, too short, generic or automatic. bad words)
